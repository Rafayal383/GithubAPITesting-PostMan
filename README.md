Modifying existing files
Committing changes
Validation Checks:
HTTP response status and headers validation
Response body structure and schema verification
Authentication and authorization handling
Key Benefits:

Easy-to-use interface for API testing with Postman
Scripted assertions using JavaScript for enhanced validation
Reusability of test collections for CI/CD integration
